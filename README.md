# visual-transformer-vs-cnn

This repository contains the code for the homework assignment of [BME VITMAV45](http://smartlab.tmit.bme.hu/oktatas-deep-learning).  

**What's the assignment?**

Our assignment is to compare visual transformers and CNNs on a computer vision task (e.g.: image classification, object detection, semantic segmention).  
We have to use an open source database (e.g.: KITTI, BDD, Ms COCO, ImageNet).  
We have to examine the differences of the solutions based on the following criteria:  
  
1. Architectural differences
2. Operational differences
3. Computational capacity requirements
4. Running time
5. Post-training accuracy


**What do we have to submit?**

* Well commented source code, uploaded to GitHub, using any of the available deep learning frameworks
* A readme with instructions on how to reproduce our results
* A briefing doucment of our results
